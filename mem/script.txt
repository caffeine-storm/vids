Here's how you can think about "memory"

- Imagine a number line
- Now put a box at each number
- Each of these boxes can hold a number

Now you can do two things
	1. read a number from a box
	2. write a number to a box

It's called "memory" because each box "remembers" what was written to it last.
If you read a box, you will get the value that was last written there.
